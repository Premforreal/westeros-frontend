# Westeros — Mock Backend README

Purpose: describe the mock-backend artifacts that support frontend development. This README intentionally omits any run/start instructions.

Contents
- `API.md` — API specification and model drafts.
- `FRONTEND_API_SURVEY.md` — mapping of frontend callers → expected endpoints and response shapes.

Notes
- Place any runnable mock code under `docs/backend/mock` or `backend/mock` if you later want a server implementation.
- This README purposefully does not include run commands or tooling recommendations to keep it focused on API design and mocks.

Next steps
- Use `API.md` and `FRONTEND_API_SURVEY.md` to implement hardcoded responses in the mock server of your choice.
